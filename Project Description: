AtliQo Telecom 5G Launch Performance Analysis Dashboard

Project Description:

This project presents a Power BI dashboard that analyzes AtliQo's performance before and after the launch of its 5G plans in May 2022. AtliQo, a leading telecom provider in India, experienced a decline in active users and revenue growth following the launch. The objective of the dashboard is to provide AtliQo’s management with a comprehensive comparison of key performance indicators (KPIs) between the pre- and post-5G launch periods, enabling them to make data-driven decisions for business recovery and growth.

Key Features:

KPI Comparison: Detailed comparison of KPIs such as active users, revenue, user engagement, and plan subscriptions before and after the 5G launch.
User Trend Analysis: Visualized trends in active users, highlighting the decline and potential areas of focus to improve user retention.
Revenue Growth Insights: Analysis of revenue trends post-5G launch to understand the impact on financial performance.
Actionable Insights: Recommendations for management on pricing optimization, targeted marketing, and plan adjustments to drive user acquisition and retention.
Interactive Visuals: Dynamic visualizations, including line charts, bar charts, and KPI cards, to provide an easy-to-understand overview for top-level management.
Management Considerations:

Adjust pricing or offer more flexible plans to attract users.
Develop targeted marketing campaigns to re-engage inactive user segments.
Improve customer experience based on performance trends.
Introduce bundle offers or limited-time discounts to boost revenue.
Tools Used:

Power BI for data visualization
SQL for data extraction and preparation
Data Source: Mock data based on AtliQo’s performance metrics.
